FPGA Implementation of Smart Water Quality Monitoring System
In our project we have integrated 3 sensors to a FPGA for monitoring water quality.The sensors are water level sensor,MQ-7 sensor(for measuring CO) and temperature sensor.The values were shown both in Arduino and FPGA. From these values we have drawn conclusion about water quality by comparing them with certain threshold values.
