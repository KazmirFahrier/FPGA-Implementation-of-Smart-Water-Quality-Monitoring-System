# FPGA-Implementation-of-Smart-Water-Quality-Monitoring-System

## Overview

This project focuses on designing and implementing a Smart Water Quality Monitoring System using FPGA technology. The system integrates three types of sensors:

- **Water Level Sensor:**  Monitors the water level to assess potential flooding or inadequate water supply.
- **MQ-7 Gas Sensor:** Detects the concentration of carbon monoxide (CO), indicating potential contamination in the water or surrounding environment.
- **Temperature Sensor (LM35):** Measures the water temperature to detect irregularities that could indicate pollution or harmful environmental changes.
  
The sensor values are captured and processed using both FPGA and Arduino platforms, with a focus on FPGA for efficient hardware-level monitoring and control. The processed data is compared to specific threshold values to provide real-time feedback on water quality.
